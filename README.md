# QSlim ported to compile on Mac OS X

This is a port of the wonderful
[QSlim](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/quadrics/qslim.html) software by
Michael Garland. I've [patched](http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=3244) it
to compile on mac os x.

## Compilation

You must first install `fltk` (e.g. using macports/homebrew). Otherwise you'll
only be able to build the command line version (in that case replace the last
`make` with `make qslim`)

```bash
cd libgfx
env CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -fpermissive" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure
make -C src
cd ../mixkit
./configure
make -C src
cd ../tools/filters
make
cd ../qslim
make
```

All of the makefiles depend on those created by the first `configure` call
inside `libgfx/`.

## Running

Double clicking on the gui version `qvis.app` will not work. The GUI only works
via the command.

```bash
./qvis.app/Contents/MacOS/qvis input.smf
```

The conversion tool `ply2smf` only works on stdin, so you'll have to do
something like:

```bash
cat input.ply | ./ply2smf >output.smf
```

## Extra tools

I've also added two tools: `tools/qslim/qvis_obj.sh` and `tools/qslim/qslim_obj.sh` which simply wrap
up some conversions so you can use these tools with .obj files.

### OVERVIEW

This is the SlimKit collection of surface modeling tools.  Most of the
programs in this collection simply provide an interface to the
underlying functionality of the MixKit library (see mixkit/README.txt).

The primary component of this package is the QSlim 2.1 surface
simplification tool located in the tools/qslim directory.  Please
consult tools/qslim/QSlim.txt for further information.  There are also
several useful programs in tools/filters/ for manipulating SMF model
files.

New in this release is the QCluster software package in tools/cluster.


### BUILDING & INSTALLATION

To build on a Unix machine:

```bash
cd libgfx
./configure
cd src; make
cd ../../mixkit
./configure
cd src; make
cd ../../tools/qslim
make all
```

I have tested this process on both Linux (Debian) and Mac OS X (10.3)
machines.  Compilation on other Unix platforms should probably work as
well.

I no longer use Windows on a regular basis, and have not updated the
Windows build files.  The Unix directions given above should work
correctly with Cygwin.  Some slightly out-of-date project files for
compiling under MS Visual C++ 6.0 can be found in SlimKit workspace in
the "win32" directory.  You can probably get them working without too
much effort.

Finally:

### FUTURE PLANS

None.  This software package has changed relatively little since its
initial public release in March 1999.  The only substantial changes were
switching to an FLTK-based GUI and repackaging some of the common code
in the new libgfx library.  I ceased active development on the
simplification-related MixKit code several years ago.  At this point, I
do not have plans for any further releases of this software.
